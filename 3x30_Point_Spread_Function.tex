\subsection{Point spread function}
Point spread function is the response of an Â´imaging' system to a point source. In the context of sound localization, this is the loci of point sound source detected by the microphone array. If the array is perfect, it detects a point precisely at the actual source location and nothing elsewhere. This however is not generally the case. For example, given a single pair of microphones, and assuming far-field incidence, the only information that can be concluded from a single point source is the angle of incidence on the array. This can be seen as either the azimuth or elevation information, with the other variable allowed to take any value between $0\degree$ to $360\degree$. This leads to a circle around the array where the source might be located.
