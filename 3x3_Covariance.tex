\subsection{Deconvolution methods and covariance matrix fitting}

Very useful for coherent sources mapping (ground effect), it also solve the SPL. It is a good method designed for a moving microphone array. Drawback are that the bigger area to investigate, the bigger the aperture of the array must be (For one position). If there is several positions used to measure then it's ok.  More on that soon
