\section{SRP-PHAT Measurement 1}

\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this experiment is to test the SRP-PHAT algorithm in a controlled environment. An experiment is set up in the Anechoic chamber, a tetrahedral microphone array receives sound waves emitted by a point source. The source position is fixed and the microphone array is rotated on the axis in order to change the wave receiving angle.
