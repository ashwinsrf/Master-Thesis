\section{Minimum power SRP PHAT using a microphone array}
\subsection{Microphone array geometry}

\subsubsection{Effect of angular resolution of localization}
Similar to the 2D angular resolution due to a single pair (Fig. \ref{fig:res_diff}), the tetrahedral array has its own 3D  angular resolution depending on the sample rate and the array aperture size. Fig. \ref{fig:res_diff_3d} describes the angular resolution of a tetrahedral array of aperture 1m for different sample rates. If the SRP search space is $360\degree$ by $180\degree$, and the resolution of search is $1\degree$, there will be some angular locations where the delay in sample between a microphone pair is fractional. For simplicity, this fractional delay is rounded for all plots in this thesis. This means that certain locations will contain duplicate data from the nearest integral delay location to themselves. Obviously, the resolution improves for higher sample rate.

\subsubsection{Effect of change in aperture size or sample rate}
As discussed above and shown in fig. \ref{fig:res_diff}, reducing the aperture size or sample rate also reduces the angular resolution of localization, which causes a direct degradation in SRP-PHAT performance. Fig. \ref{fig:4mic1srcAper} depicts the effect of reducing sample rate or aperture size on the SRP-PHAT localization results.

%\subsubsection{Effect of adding more microphones}
%It is of interest to test the scalability of the algorithm by adding more microphones. Theoretically, adding microphones should add independent pairs and thus lower the noise floor (normalized) to improve results in a low SNR scenario.

\subsubsection{Effect of error in mic position}
The microphones in the array could have an error in position, due to structural errors (structural fatigue and sag, thermal expansion/ contraction or just human error). This could lead to an error in localization. Fig. \ref{fig:micErrPos} illustrates this effect.

    \label{fig:micErrPos}
\end{figure}
